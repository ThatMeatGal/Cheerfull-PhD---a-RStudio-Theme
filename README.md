Possibly one of the moodeist README you'll come across, but here it goes... 

It was in the middle of the night, and I was browsing forums looking for ways to help debug my code when this thought came to me… If I’m staring at RStudio for hours on end, it might as well be a theme I liked 

So naturally, as a productive graduate student, I put my code aside and went on to make this color theme before promptly installing it on my computer, and it remained the active theme thereafter
Plus, working on a PhD is stressful enough most of the time, so why not make the little things in life cheerful?

Anyway, if you come across this theme, whether you like it or hate it, I hope it at least cheers you up a bit. :D

## Thoughts behind the colors in the theme: 
**Cotton Candy (Cyan and Pink)**
  - The good ol' days when I used to play ARK: Survival Evolved, I had/bred/raised a lot... a lot of cotton candy dinos... like a lot... (Boss Daeodon and CC X-Yutyrannus were my gigs, or a pack of CC Troodons roaming around, the list goes on)
  - Anyway, it's a reminder that taking a break from work/studies isn't too bad of an idea from time to time! #WorkLifeBalance ⚖️ (But really tho, what is this concept...?)

**Gold**
  - Between **_BOILER UP_** and **_GO VANDALS_**, I pretty much bleed black and gold at this point

**Black (Background)**
  - Read bullet point under Gold
  - Nerd bit of the day, learned in communication class that dark background with light words captures attention better, hence also why all my presentations follow this format ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**Off White**
  - Data analysis is still a serious thing... so is grad school... I mean... and something plain needs to be in there to balance out all the colors
  - Off white is a little softer on the dark background

## Install the theme to RStudio
- Download the theme (Cheerful PhD.tmTheme)
- Open RStudio (duh) ➡️ Edit ➡️ Appearance ➡️ Click on "Add" below the "Editor theme:" box ➡️ Select the downloaded theme
- From there you can see a preview of the theme, and decide if you would like to use it ☑️

Hope you enjoy, \
A cheerful PhD student
